LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM PROTOTYPE

The software system intended to fulfil the basic requirements of a library to make it easier for users to execute queries about
books, members or staff and provide the ability to manage them using a computer. An SQLite database was used to store the data 
for this database which can be found within the folder of the application. Three users were implemented into the system which 
were members of the library, the librarians and the admins.

Requirements:
Java - https://www.java.com/en/download/

Running the application:

This application can be run by executing the java file 'Library Management System'.

You can log in using these log in credentials:

For a admin     - userID: 1, password: admin
For a member    - userID: 2, password: member
For a Librarian - userID: 3, password: librarian

You may add your own members and/or librarians once you have logged in.
Admins can only be added manually into the SQLite database by using SQL Scripts.


Features not yet implemented:
Automatic fining system
Ability for members to reserve books
Passwords need to be encypted
