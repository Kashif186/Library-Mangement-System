LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM PROTOTYPE

The software system intended to fulfil the basic requirements of a library to make it easier for users to execute queries about
books, members or staff and provide the ability to manage them using a computer. An SQLite database was used to store the data 
for this database which can be found within the folder of the application. Three users were implemented into the system which 
were members of the library, the librarians and the admins.
